## Take-Home Case: Design a Document Management System (DMS)

### Problem Overview

You are tasked with designing a cloud-based Document Management System that includes:

- **Document Storage**: Secure and scalable document storage on the cloud.
- **Document Processing**: File transformations like PDF splitting or AI-based OCR based on project-specific rules.
- **A secure Web UI** to manage and upload files (think OneDrive/Google Drive).

## Aspects to Cover

### 1. Development Process
How would you go about developing the application, and how you would leverage AI tools to be faster while keeping code quality.

### 2. Choice of Cloud Provider
Select a cloud provider for the DMS solution.

### 3. Compute Platform Choice / Scalability / Performance
Choose a compute platform and discuss scalability and performance considerations.

### 4. CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Define the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure management strategy.

### 5. Observability & Metrics
Discuss the monitoring and metrics strategy to track system performance and uptime.

### 6. Choice of Stack for Frontend, Backend, and other services
Select the technology stack for the frontend, backend, and any other service you might want to use, explaining pros and cons of choices.

### 7. Architecture for File Processing
Define the architecture for processing uploaded files.

### 8. Authentication Strategy (Web)
Explain the authentication strategy for both the web application and the upload agent.

### 9. Choice of Database
Choose a database solution for storing document information and enabling search functionality.

## Considerations

### Deliverables

#### Pre-Interview:
- Short < 5 min high-level presentation (ideally a 5-minute Loom video) to be submitted before the interview.

#### Interview:
- Present a 15-minute high-level overview of your solution.
- Architecture Diagram showing key components and their interactions.
- Rest is up to you. You can have additional slides if you are more comfortable, or otherwise just use whiteboard to be able to go into questions in more detail.

#### Additional Notes:
- No code is expected, the focus is on the high-level components that make up the solution. However, if you want to present something that showcases your focus on high-quality code, you are welcome to provide that.
- It's not an exam, but trying to provide a playground for having a discussion around a complex problem. You can make assumptions and use them to justify your solution if they are reasonable.
